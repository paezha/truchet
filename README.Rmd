This package implements the multi-scale Truchet tiles of [Christopher Carlson](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2018/bridges2018-39.html) as explained in this [blog post](https://christophercarlson.com/portfolio/multi-scale-truchet-patterns/). This implementation uses the package [{sf}]() to create and manipulate spatial objects. Two functions are used to create tiles and then to arrange the tiles in a mosaic. Since the tiles and mosaics are simple features, they can be plotted using [{ggplot2}]() and `geom_sf()`. In addition, further manipulations of the tiles (such as buffering) can be done using the functionality of {sf}.

## Installation

You can install the development version of truchet from [GitHub](https://github.com/paezha/truchet) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paezha/truchet")
```

## Example

Once installed, the package can be loaded in the usual way:
```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(truchet)
```

## Tiles

These are sample tiles. The complete list of tiles implemented in the package appears at the bottom.

### Tile of type "d" or "\\" and "/" in Carlson's notation.

Using function `st_truchet_p()` with type "dl" or "dr" produces a simple features data frame with the elements of a single tile, diagonal left ("\\") or diagonal right ("/"). In addition to the geometry of the spatial elements of the tiles, the data frame includes identifiers for tiles (i.e., tile 1 is "\\" and tile 2 is "/") as well as colors. The function accepts the coordinates of the tile.

```{r}
st_truchet_p(x = 1, y = 4, type = "dl") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color)))
```

### Tile of type "-" or "-" and "|" in Carlson's notation.

Using function `st_truchet_p()` with type "-" or "|" produces a simple features data frame with the elements of a single tile, horizontal ("-") or vertical  ("|"). In addition to the geometry of the spatial elements of the tiles, the data frame includes identifiers for tiles (i.e., tile 1 is "|" and tile 2 is "-") as well as colors.

```{r}
st_truchet_p(x = 0, y = 0, type = "|") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color)))
```

### Tile of type "f" in Carlson's notation.

Using function `st_truchet_p()` with type "fnw", "fne", "fse", or "fsw" produces a data frame with the elements of a single tile. In addition to the geometry of the spatial elements of the tiles, the data frame includes identifiers for tiles and colors.
```{r}
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 0, y = 2, type = "fnw"),
          aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 2, y = 2, type = "fne"),
          aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 2, y = 0, type = "fse"),
          aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 0, y = 0, type = "fsw"),
          aes(fill = factor(color)))
```

## Tile scales

Carlson's tiles are designed to work at multiple scales. At the moment, the function to create tiles supports scale 1 (the tiles are squares with sides of length 1), scale 1/2 (sides of tile are of length 1/2), and scales 1/4 (sides of tile are of length 1/4). I don't see much point doing tiles smaller than this, as their effect can be replicated with bigger tiles in bigger mosaics, and when used in multi-scale mosaics, the detail is lost at smaller scales. Argument `scale_p` is used to select the scale of the output tile (the default is 1). Notice that the colors alternate at each scale.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 0, y = 0, type = "dl", scale_p = 1),
          aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 2, y = 0, type = "dl", scale_p = 1/2),
          aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_sf(data = st_truchet_p(x = 4, y = 0, type = "dl", scale_p = 1/4),
          aes(fill = factor(color)))
```

## Assembling a mosaic

It is possible to assemble the tiles into a mosaic manually, but an additional function offers some functionality to do this task.

Function `st_truchet_ms()` can be used with all default parameters. The default uses tiles of type `dl` and `dr`, which are positioned at random (with equal probability) on the mosaic:
```{r}
st_truchet_ms() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color)),
          color = NA)
```

It is possible to create mosaics with tiles of different sizes; the parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` control the proportion of tiles at each scale:
```{r}
st_truchet_ms(p1 = 0.6, p2 = 0.3, p3 = 0.1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color)),
          color = NA)
```

Mosaics can use different types of tiles: 
```{r}
st_truchet_ms(tiles = c("-", "|", "dl")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color)),
          color = NA)
```

## Tile collection

These are all the tiles currently implemented:
```{r}
# Mosaic types
mosaic_types <- data.frame(type = c("dl", "dr", "-", "|", "fnw", "fne", "fsw", "fse", "+", "+.", "x.", "tn", "ane", "asw")) %>%
  mutate(tile = 1:n(),
         x = 2 * tile %% 5,
         y = 2 * tile %/% 5)

# Elements for assemblig the mosaic
x_c <- mosaic_types$x
y_c <- mosaic_types$y
type <- as.character(mosaic_types$type)
scale_p <- rep(1, nrow(mosaic_types))

pmap_dfr(list(x_c, y_c, type, scale_p), st_truchet_p) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = factor(color))) +
  geom_text(data = mosaic_types,
            aes(x = x,
                y = y,
                label = type),
            nudge_y = 1)
```
